Das Hauptaugenmerk liegt auf dem theoretisch komplexen Wechselverha\xcc\x88ltnis zwischen Sprache und Bildlichkeit. Die neutestamentlichen Texte zum \x1em Gottes" beleuchtet die Autorin hier in den Sinndimensionen, wie sie sich im 1. und 2. Jahrhundert dargeboten haben. Der Blick geht hierbei auf die Gotteslamm-Metapher im Neuen Testament und die vielfa\xcc\x88ltigen religionsgeschichtlichen Anknu\xcc\x88pfungspunkte in Texten und Artefakten der antiken Umwelt. Ausgehend von dieser Grundlage betrachtet die Autorin die vielfa\xcc\x88ltigen Bildzeugnisse aus der zweitausendja\xcc\x88hrigen Kunstgeschichte in einem typologisch ausgerichteten La\xcc\x88ngsschnitt, der dazu dient, die semantische Vielfalt in eine systematische Betrachtung des Bildmaterials zu u\xcc\x88bersetzen. So gelingt ihr eine Darstellung, wie sich im Lauf der Jahrhunderte in der Rezeption der biblischen Metapher durch bildende Ku\xcc\x88nstler neue Sinnpotentiale entfaltet haben. Zum Abschluss geht der Verstehensweg von den Bildzeugnissen noch einmal zuru\xcc\x88ck zum Text.
