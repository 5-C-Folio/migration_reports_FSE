## Records failed to migrate due to Value errors found in Transformation - 234836 things
The following patterns occured more than 50 times. They have a 336 without a $b, $atext, $asounds, $atwo-dimensional, $aperformed music, $anotated music, $astill image. 
Since they have 336 fields, the system wants to take the Instance type from 336$b, and since there is no $b parsing of the record fails. 
This can be handled, either by you, or as a preprocessing step at migration.

The world of offshore finance is one of dummy companies, shadow bank accounts, post office boxes, foreign registries, and the like, which allow giant corporations--such as Wal-Mart, British Petroleum, and Citigroup--to keep huge profits out of sight of investors, regulators, and the public. A third of the world\'s wealth is held offshore. Half the capital in the world\'s stock exchanges is "parked" offshore at some point. Reporter and private investigator Brittain-Catlin tells how tax havens have become central to global finance today; in so doing, he takes us into the secret networks of Enron and Parmalat, behind international trade disputes, and into organized crime and terror networks, giving evidence that the key value of capitalism and civilization alike--freedom--is being put in grave danger.--From publisher description.\x1e  \x1faView table of contents on the Internet via the World Wide Web.\x1e 0\x1faCayman Islands\x1fxEconomic conditions.\x1e 0\x1faTax havens\x1fzCayman Islands.\x1e 0\x1faInternational finance\x1fxPolitical aspects\x1fzCayman Islands.\x1e 0\x1faCommercial crimes\x1fzCayman Islands.\x1e 0\x1faTransnational crime\x1fzCayman Islands.\x1e41\x1f3Table of contents\x1fuhttp://www.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip0510/2005010170.html\x1e  \x1fa92\x1fbAUM\x1e  \x1fauau\x1fb10-30-05\x1fcm\x1fda\x1fe-\x1ffeng\x1fgnyu\x1fh0\x1e  \x1faHA\x1e  \x1fa.b3406106x\x1fb11-21-05\x1fc08-30-05\x1e  \x1faAUMM\x1e  \x1faPROMPTCAT\x1e\x1d'\

The only thing that she can look forward to is her trip abroad in a few days. But one day, her father leaves home without any notice. Her mother doesn't care what happens to him and doesn't care to look for him. Na-y\xc5\x8fng has no choice but to give up her dream trip abroad and to search for her father instead. Once she arrives at her parents' hometown, Na-y\xc5\x8fng falls into the time and place her mother lived in 30 years ago. After falling into this mysterious world, Na-y\xc5\x8fng gets tangled up in the middle of the love that unfolds between her mother and father.\x1e  \x1faSpecial features (not subtitled) on disc 2 include: behind-the-scenes footage, outtakes, and deleted scenes.\x1e10\x1faKw\xc5\x8fn, Hye-w\xc5\x8fn\x1fvFilm adaptations.\x1e 0\x1faMothers and daughters\x1fzKorea (South)\x1fvDrama.\x1e 0\x1faFathers and daughters\x1fzKorea (South)\x1fvDrama.\x1e 0\x1faFamilies\x1fzKorea (South)\x1fvDrama.\x1e 0\x1faTime travel\x1fvDrama.\x1e 7\x1faFamilies.\x1f2fast\x1f0(OCoLC)fst01728849\x1e 7\x1faFathers and daughters.\x1f2fast\x1f0(OCoLC)fst00921890\x1e 7\x1faMothers and daughters.\x1f2fast\x1f0(OCoLC)fst01026997\x1e 7\x1faTime travel.\x1f2fast\x1f0(OCoLC)fst01151176\x1e 7\x1faKorea (South)\x1f2fast\x1f0(OCoLC)fst01206791\x1e 7\x1faFiction films.\x1f2lcgft\x1e 7\x1faFeature films.\x1f2lcgft\x1e 4\x1faFeature films\x1fzKorea (South)\x1e 4\x1faForeign language films\x1fxKorean.\x1e 7\x1faFeature films.\x1f2gsafd\x1e 7\x1faDrama.\x1f2fast\x1f0(OCoLC)fst01423879\x1e 7\x1faFeature films.\x1f2fast\x1f0(OCoLC)fst01710384\x1e 7\x1faFiction films.\x1f2fast\x1f0(OCoLC)fst01710264\x1e 7\x1faFilm adaptations.\x1f2fast\x1f0(OCoLC)fst01710491\x1e1 \x1f6880-05\x1faLee, Joon-dong.\x1e1 \x1f6880-06\x1faKw\xc5\x8fn, Hye-w\xc5\x8fn.\x1e1 \x1f6880-07\x1faPak, H\xc5\xadng-sik,\x1fd1962-\x1e1 \x1f6880-08\x1faSong, Hye-jin,\x1fd1974-\x1e1 \x1f6880-09\x1faChin, H\xc5\xadi-mun.\x1e1 \x1f6880-10\x1faCh\xc5\x8fn, To-y\xc5\x8fn,\x1fd1973-\x1e1 \x1f6880-11\x1faPark, Hae-il,\x1fd1977-\x1e1 \x1f6880-12\x1faKo, Tu-sim.\x1e2 \x1faUniKorea (Firm)\x1e2 \x1f6880-13\x1faP'\xc5\xadrimi\xc5\x8f Ent'\xc5\x8ft'einm\xc5\x8fnt'\xc5\xad (Firm)\x1e2 \x1f6880-14\x1faNau P\xca\xbbill\xc5\xadm (Chu)\x1e00\x1f6245-01/\x1fa\xec\x9d\xb8\xec\x96\xb4\xea\xb3\xb5\xec\xa3\xbc /\x1fc\xec\xa0\x9c\xea\xb3\xb5, Unikorea ; \xec\xa0\x9c\xec\x9e\x91, \xeb\x82\x98\xec\x9a\xb0\xed\x95\x84\xeb\xa6\x84 ; \xea\xb8\xb0\xed\x9a\x8d/\xec\xa0\x9c\xec\x9e\x91, \xec\x9d\xb4\xec\xa4\x80\xeb\x8f\x99 ; \xec\x9b\x90\xec\x95\x88, \xea\xb6\x8c\xed\x98\x9c\xec\x9b\x90 ; \xec\x8b\x9c\xeb\x82\x98\xeb\xa6\xac\xec\x98\xa4, \xeb\xb0\x95\xed\x9d\xa5\xec\x8b\x9d, \xec\x86\xa1\xed\x98\x9c\xec\xa7\x84 ; \xed\x94\x84\xeb\xa1\x9c\xeb\x93\x80\xec\x84\x9c, \xec\xa7\x84\xed\x9d\xac\xeb\xac\xb8 ; \xea\xb0\x90\xeb\x8f\x85, \xeb\xb0\x95\xed\x9d\xa5\xec\x8b\x9d.\x1e 1\x1f6264-02/\x1fa[\xec\x84\x9c\xec\x9a\xb8] :\x1fb\xed\x94\x84\xeb\xa6\xac\xeb\xaf\xb8\xec\x96\xb4\xec\x97\x94\xed\x84\xb0\xed\x85\x8c\xec\x9d\xb8\xeb\xa8\xbc\xed\x8a\xb8,\x1fc2004.\x1e1 \x1f6511-03/\x1fa\xec\xa0\x84\xeb\x8f\x84\xec\x97\xb0, \xeb\xb0\x95\xed\x95\xb4\xec\x9d\xbc, \xea\xb3\xa0\xeb\x91\x90\xec\x8b\xac.\x1e  \x1f6508-04/\x1fa\xec\xb4\xac\xec\x98\x81\xea\xb0\x90\xeb\x8f\x85, \xec\xb5\x9c\xec\x98\x81\xed\x83\x9d ; \xed\x8e\xb8\xec\xa7\x91, \xea\xb9\x80\xec\x96\x91\xec\x9d\xbc ; \xec\x9d\x8c\xec\x95\x85, \xec\xa1\xb0\xec\x84\xb1\xec\x9a\xb0 (M&F).\x1e1 \x1f6700-05/\x1fa\xec\x9d\xb4\xec\xa4\x80\xeb\x8f\x99.\x1e1 \x1f6700-06/\x1fa\xea\xb6\x8c\xed\x98\x9c\xec\x9b\x90.\x1e1 \x1f6700-07/\x1fa\xeb\xb0\x95\xed\x9d\xa5\xec\x8b\x9d,\x1fd1962-\x1e1 \x1f6700-08/\x1fa\xec\x86\xa1\xed\x98\x9c\xec\xa7\x84,\x1fd1974-\x1e1 \x1f6700-09/\x1fa\xec\xa7\x84\xed\x9d\xac\xeb\xac\xb8.\x1e1 \x1f6700-10/\x1fa\xec\xa0\x84\xeb\x8f\x84\xec\x97\xb0,\x1fd1973-\x1e1 \x1f6700-11/\x1fa\xeb\xb0\x95\xed\x95\xb4\xec\x9d\xbc,\x1fd1977-\x1e1 \x1f6700-12/\x1fa\xea\xb3\xa0\xeb\x91\x90\xec\x8b\xac.\x1e2 \x1f6710-13/\x1fa\xed\x94\x84\xeb\xa6\xac\xeb\xaf\xb8\xec\x96\xb4\xec\x97\x94\xed\x84\xb0\xed\x85\x8c\xec\x9d\xb8\xeb\xa8\xbc\xed\x8a\xb8 (Firm)\x1e2 \x1f6710-14/\x1fa\xeb\x82\x98\xec\x9a\xb0\xed\x95\x84\xeb\xa6\x84 (Firm)\x1e  \x1faC0\x1fbSNN\x1e  \x1faSM\x1e  \x1faSNNZ\x1e\x1d"\
